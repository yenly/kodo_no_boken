I've decided to participate in the [#100DaysOfCode Challenge](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/start-2017-with-the-100daysofcode-improved-and-updated-18ce604b237b#.ukkzk5ft9) starting on February 20, 2017.
I will code for at least an hour every day focused on building projects. Times spent working through lessons and tutorials does not apply to this hour. I will use this blog to track my progress under the category, 100DaysOfCode.
