Today I worked on setting up [Exercism's](http://exercism.io/) ECMAScript language module in my command line client. Also fetched a good number of exercises for python and javascript modules to have on hand to work on during my flight to Colombia. I worked through Hello World example to ensure my environment is set up correctly.
