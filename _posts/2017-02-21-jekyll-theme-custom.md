After some research and poking around in the code in packaged themes available online, I decided I need to plan my customizing strategy from sparse content to integrating this blog to my portfolio site. To start, dive into SASS and customize default theme, [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima). As my content and usage grow, I will create my own gem-based theme to address my needs.
