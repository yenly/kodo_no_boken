Today I worked on changing the look of Minima styles to my liking. This exercise helped me understand the workings of Jekyll templating and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/). I'm liking this simple blog engine. Changes are minor for now because the important thing is having this tool to use as I focus on working on bigger projects.
