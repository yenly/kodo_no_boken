### Today's Progress:
Today I worked on setting up the basic link structure of my portfolio site by installing React-Router and then defining routes to placeholder components.

### Thoughts:
I need to plan how I want to organize my content as well as a basic layout of my site. I plan to eventually deploy this to Github pages. React-Router will have [some issues](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/tree/master/packages/react-scripts/template#github-pages) with browserHistory on Github pages. Fix can be found in this guide, [Single Page Apps for GitHub Pages](https://github.com/rafrex/spa-github-pages).
