### Today's Progress:
Today I worked on adding project details component to my portfolio react app. I installed packages: redux, react-redux, and redux-devtools. I started working on creating a project reducer to hold my content.


### Thoughts:
I only have an hour and not enough of a plan. Part of me wants to address the issue of deploying a single page app to Github to ensure it works before moving forward. Another part of me does not want to test deploy work in progress code. Indecisions.
