### Today's Progress:
Today I worked on using Redux to manage my project list content. It is a bit much for my sparse content but I want this to be an exercise of using Redux without all the complexity of APIs and database calls to interfere my learning. Those complexities will come later.


### Thoughts:
It's been almost two months since I used Redux. My memories of how is a bit hazy and just referring to my other implementations on Github doesn't give me enough of an understanding. I may need to review some of the instructional videos to help me fix this bug.
