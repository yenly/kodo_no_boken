### Today's Progress:
Today I worked on fixing the connection bug between my projects reducer to my project container. I also connect projects component to use project details component to display my content.

### Thoughts:
I'm starting to think ahead to next steps. I want to only display a demo link if I have something deployed. I also need to decide what kind of project image to add.
