Today I learned to build a blog using Django framework at a Django Girls Workshop hosted at Elastic Search in Mountain View. The tech stack for this application is Python, Django, sqlite3, Jinja, HTML, and CSS from scratch. I liked that this workshop encouraged frequent commits and pushes to Github as well as deploys to Python Anywhere for hosting. I had lots of fun learning and making friends at this workshop. The environment was friendly and supportive. Beyond the code, there were lightning talks and great advice by wonderful coaches.
