### Today's Progress:
Today I worked on changing the layout of my project list to display two columns in preparation for adding a screen capture to each project. I also tried out [RecordIt](http://recordit.co/) to generate an animated gif of my web app in action.

### Thoughts:
I decided to change React Router to use hashHistory for better functionality on Github pages. I prefer to go with simple solution than to use a workaround that doesn't give me that much more on such a simple site.
