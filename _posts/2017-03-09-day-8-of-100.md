### Today's Progress:
Today I started working on a new react app to generate random quotes. This one will be an exercise on how to use Firebase database with React. I installed firebase package and configured API key. Also created a placeholder quote component.

### Thoughts:
I need a good resource that will help me understand how to build a NoSQL database model.
