### Today's Progress:
Today I...
* Created quotes data model structured in JSON format and import into Firebase database. Sample data of 15 quotes for now.
* Connected app to database and display quote and author.
* Added ability to tweet quote.
* Added some CSS layout styles utilizing flexbox.

### Thoughts:
For such a simple app, it's nice to skip using large Bootstrap 4 framework and go back to using my foundational CSS knowledge.
