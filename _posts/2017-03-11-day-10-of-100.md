### Today's Progress:
Today I worked on adding logic to generate a random quote id based on the number of quotes from my database. I also add the logic to new quote button to display a new random quote when a user clicks on it.

### Thoughts:
The logic needs more refinement. I initially started with wanting to keep track of quote history so the user won't have a repeat. However, I need to consider what happens when the user cycles through the entire collection.
