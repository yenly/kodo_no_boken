### Today's Progress:
Today I worked on breaking my getQuote function into smaller modular functions. By doing so, I fixed the bug where the first time a user clicks on new quote button, the quote doesn't change. But it changes for subsequent clicks.

### Thoughts:
I need a better understanding of ```this.setState``` in React. In console logging my variables before and after ```this.setState```, I discover the variable did not update as I had expect it to.
