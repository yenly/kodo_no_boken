### Today's Progress:
I worked on the UI layer of my Random Quote app. I decided to give React-Bootstrap package a try even though I am not a fan of it tying me to an older version of bootstrap. I imported more quotes into my Firebase database and ran a test deploy.

### Thoughts:
Pretty neat to see it all connected and working nicely. I may try out implementing Twitter authentication with Firebase.
