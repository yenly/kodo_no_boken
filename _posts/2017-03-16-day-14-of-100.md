### Today's Progress:
I cleaned up and comment out placeholder code for future use. I deployed to Github pages and also imported 100 quotes into my Firebase database.

### Thoughts:
I decided to hold off on implementing Twitter authentication on Firebase because it feels like I am overdoing this simple app for now. This simple app would be a good candidate to try adding following features as an exercise for my learning:
* Convert to be a [Progressive Web App](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) following [Create-React-PWA](https://github.com/jeffposnick/create-react-pwa) instructions.
* Let user log in with twitter account.
* User can quote without app having to pop up a brand new browser window.
