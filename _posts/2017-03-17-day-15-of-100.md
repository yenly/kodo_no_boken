### Today's Progress:
I worked on my portfolio site. I add my latest project, [Random Quote](https://yenly.github.io/random_quote/), to projects list. I also created a placeholder component to share my art.

### Thoughts:
It was good to take a break from this project. The short break gave me a chance to add more meaningful content to this project. I am hoping it will help me move pass my indecisions on design.
