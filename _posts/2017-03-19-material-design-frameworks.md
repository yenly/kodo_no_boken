I fell into the rabbit hole of researching Material Design Frameworks to use with React. What is [Material Design by Google](https://material.io/)? "Material Design is a unified system that combines theory, resources, and tools for crafting digital experiences." As I strive to be a full stack engineer, I feel an understanding of these concepts would be a good tool set to have.
