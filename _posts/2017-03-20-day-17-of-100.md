### Today's Progress:
I spent today evaluating several UI frameworks for React. Some based on Material Design and some not. Listed are the four below. I test each one by implementing similar components across the frameworks. This allows me to see it's limitations as well as capabilities.

### Thoughts:
I'm discovering the fully featured frameworks can be limiting.
