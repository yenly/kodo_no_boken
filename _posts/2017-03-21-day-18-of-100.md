### Today's Progress:
I installed [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/) and tried out some components.

### Thoughts:
I'm tempted by the [latest alpha version](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) because of the responsive UI layout feature but as this is my first time using, I should let the development of the alpha version stabilize further.
