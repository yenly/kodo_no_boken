### Today's Progress:
I finished coding the final UI for my portfolio site for now. I decided to go with a more design feel by using SVG background pattern from [Hero Patterns](http://www.heropatterns.com/){:target="_blank"}. First time I saw the website, I fell in love with the default color scheme.

### Thoughts:
Yay for [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics){:target="_blank"} because of faster load time. I'm not sure I understand why the Create React App tool comes with deploy script that only deploys to gh-pages branch but not master branch. So far deploying my projects as a subset of [yenly.github.io]((https://yenly.github.io)) is so easy. But for my personal main site, [Github requires the site to run on master branch](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/){:target="_blank"}.  No easy direct deploy. I worked around it by deploying a production build locally and then uploading it to master. Works like a charm. I have more to add to this site but right now I need to shelf it and move on.
