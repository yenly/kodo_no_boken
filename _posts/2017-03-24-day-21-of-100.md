### Today's Progress:
I finished coding the final UI for my portfolio site for now. I decided to go with a more design feel by using SVG background pattern from [Hero Patterns](http://www.heropatterns.com/){:target="_blank"}. First time I saw the website, I fell in love with the default color scheme.

### Thoughts:
Yay for [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics){:target="_blank"} because of faster load time. I have more to add to this site but right now I need to self it and move on.
