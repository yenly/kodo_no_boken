### Today's Progress:
I revisited how to do an API request and parsing of data using python. I'm researching the data to decide what to do with my next simple app.

### Thoughts:
Just hit me that I I haven't touch Python API requests since last December. I've spent too much time on javascript with React and ES6 and not enough python. I need a better strategy to spread my learning for better coverage. Too much time away on either language disrupts my deep practice.
