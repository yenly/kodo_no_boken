### Today's Progress:
I spent today getting familiar with the Github repo for [Techtonica](http://techtonica.org/){:target="_blank"}, a non-profit coding bootcamp for local women and non-binary femme adults in need. I wanted to contribute to this meaningful project for the longest time. I picked an easy open issue to start with. However I ran into a really weird caching issue with SASS,CSS, & Flask in Chrome that took way too much time.

### Thoughts:
This repo needs a better-detailed documentation and contribution guidelines. For a first timer like me, the amount of time spent in unnecessary confusion could be a barrier to more engagement.
