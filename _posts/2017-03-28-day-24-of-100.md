### Today's Progress:
Today I started working on another simple app, Weather, by bootstrapping the boilerplate with Create-React-App. This time I would like to build with test-driven development practices. I am inspired by watching this talk, [Jest Snapshots and Beyond](http://conf.reactjs.org/speakers/rogelio){:target="_blank"}.

### Thoughts:
I also want this simple app to be an exercise in using promises and async functions.
