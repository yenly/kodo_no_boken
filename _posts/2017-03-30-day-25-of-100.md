### Today's Progress:
Today I worked on install and config setitngs of a new Django app.

### Thoughts:
Now that I've completed all the Django Girls exercises from start to deploying to Heroku, I am ready to build my own Django app. I've decided to revisit the requirements for movie ratings flask app during my Hackbright lab days as guidelines for the new app. I remember this to be sound advice from an engineering manager from Dropbox as a way to build on my learning.
