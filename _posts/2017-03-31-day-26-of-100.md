### Today's Progress:
Today I worked on getting the user's location by using the browser's geolocation API. Then from there, I used async/await method to fetch weather data from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/){:target="_blank"} and save relevant data to state.

### Thoughts:
I still need a better understanding of state and component lifecycle. The sequence of how data flows isn't displaying as I expect them to.
