### Today's Progress:
I changed the way the latitude and longitude are stored. Instead of having defaults stored in state, I moved the geolocation fetching code into the constructor and passed the variables to my async/await function to fetch data from Open Weather Map API. I also created a placeholder component to display my weather details.

### Thoughts:
I like this method of not saving latitude and longitude in the state since I don't need it for render().
