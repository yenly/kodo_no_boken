### Today's Progress:
I added a function to convert UTC timestamp to local time for sunset and sunrise times. I also added functions to convert temperature in kelvin to fahrenheit or celsius. I added conditional to render loading div while I am waiting for my data to return.

### Thoughts:
I'm still wrapping my head around state and lifecycle hooks.
