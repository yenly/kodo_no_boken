### Today's Progress:
Today I worked on creating the first draft of my data model for my Django app. I had to change it according to the newly updated MovieLens datasets. I'm hoping to seed into my database the larger datasets released in October 2016.

### Thoughts:
This is a good exercise in using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/){:target="_blank"} framework. This won't be as straight forward as just following along the old Hackbright exercise. The challenge in working with changes will deepen my learning.
