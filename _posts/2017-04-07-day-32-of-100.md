### Today's Progress:
I fixed the foreign key issue in my data model. Because the movie_id in the given data set are not serial, then I can not use the id auto field. I had to create a movie_id field and point my foreign key to it.

### Thoughts:
I also ran into an issue with Django makemigrations script not updating my PostgresSQL database. I had to drop the database and create a brand new one to start over. I ran makemigrations and migrate so many times! This is a reminder to `psql databasename` to explore to see if my changes in data model are in effect.

Success! :smile:
