### Today's Progress:
I worked on adding custom weather icons mapping to the icon code given by [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/){:target="_blank"}. I spent some time refactoring and breaking the code into smaller functions.

### Thoughts:
I'm thinking about using this app as an exercise in playing with Styled Components.
