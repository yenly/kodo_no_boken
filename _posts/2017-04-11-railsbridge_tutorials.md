Today I took a break from my [100 Days of Code](https://yenly.github.io/kodo_no_boken/100daysofcode/2017/01/02/100days-of-code.html) project building to learn Ruby on Rails. Why another language and framework? I have my eye on a meaningful open source project that I would like to contribute and they happen to be using Rails stack. I'm aware adding another language as a code newbie is difficult but I believe being polyglot would be beneficial for the long game for my career. I see similarities in Rails and Django, however, I do need to review Ruby fundamentals.
