### Today's Progress:
I did a test deploy and was reminded by Chrome the issues of connecting to OpenWeatherMap's unsecured API. Even though my app is on https,  calling an API with HTTP causes errors. I found Dark Sky API which serves up https but then discovered they disabled [cross origin resource sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS){:target="_blank"}.

### Thoughts:
I thought it would be straightforward refactor my code to use a new API and yet I fell into the rabbit hole of researching CORS and async/await without finding any helpful answers yet.

Helpful resources:

* [Dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv){:target="_blank"}
