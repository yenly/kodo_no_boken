### Today's Progress:
Yesterday was a rest day from coding and I spent most of it researching ideas for my next simple app. Today I researched Twitter API and Watson Developer Cloud APIs. I set up a simple node app and test the connections to each API and its capabilities. Then I tried taking sample data from one API to feed into another to analyze.

### Thoughts:
As I'm trying out connecting these APIs, I'm starting to get a clear idea of what my next simple app would be.
