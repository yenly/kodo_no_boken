### Today's Progress:
Today I researched ways to chart my data. I was inspired by Peggy Rayzis' [Cross-Platform Data Visualization with React and React Native](http://conf.reactjs.org/speakers/peggy){:target="_blank"} talk at [React Conf 2017](http://conf.reactjs.org/){:target="_blank"} to try out [Victory](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory){:target="_blank"}.

### Thoughts:
The Victory tutorial and library is so cool to chart with. My front end ideas are starting to come together for my simple app.

Helpful resources:
* [Victory](http://formidable.com/open-source/victory/){:target="_blank"}
* [Recharts ](https://github.com/recharts/recharts){:target="_blank"}
* [Using dotenv with ES6 modules](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv/issues/133){:target="_blank"}
