### Today's Progress:
The next challenge that isn't clear to me is how to connect an express server to client react apps. In looking for answers, I fell into the rabbit hole of researching Socket.io. Most examples and tutorials are for real time chat which doesn't really meet my current needs.

### Thoughts:
I found lots of resources for future app ideas. I wish Socket.io would have more demos in other use cases.


Helpful resources:
* [Socket.io](https://socket.io/){:target="_blank"}
* [Socket.io-client](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client){:target="_blank"}
* [Socket.io with React Create App - Importing an npm module on client-side](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/948)
* [Socket.io-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io-react){:target="_blank"}
