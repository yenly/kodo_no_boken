I attended the ReactVR workshop at [F8 2017](https://www.fbf8.com/){:target="_blank"}. Our instructor had issues with his laptop so it was more of discussions on core concepts than a code along. I find this more helpful as a first introduction versus racing through copying code in less an hour. Code alongs with explanations are better consumed at a slower pace for better understanding.
