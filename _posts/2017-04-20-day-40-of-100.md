### Today's Progress:
Today I learned how to connect an express server to client react app while concurrently running on two ports at the same time. I'm still trying to wrap my head around where and how to deal with data on the full stack. Now I have a skeleton plan for my next app.

### Thoughts:
The feeling when confusion finally clears feels darn good. I will need to look for best practices for different use cases.
