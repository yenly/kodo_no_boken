Today I took a break from my [100 Days of Code](https://yenly.github.io/kodo_no_boken/100daysofcode/2017/01/02/100days-of-code.html) project building to attend RailsBridge Ruby on Rails Workshop hosted at Instacart. It was good to step through the Intro to Rails tutorial again with others. I appreciated having mentors explain the magic behind the framework. They fed our curiosity and stepped through installing [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise){:target="_blank"} and implementing user authentication on our simple app.
