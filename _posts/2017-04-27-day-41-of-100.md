### Today's Progress:
Today I worked on creating an Express React Starter repo to use for future apps. I test deployed my first [Express React repo](https://github.com/yenly/express_react) to Heroku and found it broken. I feel it's important to build a starter repo that I know will work when deployed. I revisited Full Stack React tutorial and used their simple server verses using [Express generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html){:target="_blank"} since I don't need the routes and views. I ran into some JSON bug trying to fetch data from my express server.

### Thoughts:
I've been so knee deep in backend code that I needed to take a few days off from project building to review front end technologies like SASS, flexbox, and Jquery. In order to keep concepts fresh in my learning, I need to systematically review all levels of the tech stack.
