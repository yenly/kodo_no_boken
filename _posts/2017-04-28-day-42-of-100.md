### Today's Progress:
I sorted out the JSON bug when fetching data from my express server. Cleaned up the code and upload repo as Express React Starter repo. I then cloned it and installed twitter and dotenv packages for my Analyze Twit app.  

### Thoughts:
I need more practice in fetching and parsing larger JSON data. I am feeling good about creating a good starter repo to use for my future app development.
