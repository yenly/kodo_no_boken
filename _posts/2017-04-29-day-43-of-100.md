### Today's Progress:
I worked on ensuring connections to APIs(Twitter, Watson Tone Analyzer) are working and returning expected data. Making good progress.

### Thoughts:
This is turning out to be too much fun. Even though some variables are hardcoded for now, I am excited to see the retrieved data made on the backend server changed by me and sent to the client.
