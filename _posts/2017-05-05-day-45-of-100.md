### Today's Progress:
Today I worked on creating results and tone chart component to display tone analysis data returned by the Watson API. I came across an issue with my fetch call not being able to get the data from my express server.

### Thoughts:
What a weird bug. The code is exactly the same as my test code and yet my response is 200. The only difference is my components are in a sub-folder of src.
