### Today's Progress:
Today I solved the fetch issue! Looks like fetch API code should be placed as helper functions in the root level of src folder. This way my components in the sub-folder can import these helper functions and use them in my componentsDidMount function.

### Thoughts:
Looks like this is a better approach with cleaner easier to read code.
