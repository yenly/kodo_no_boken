### Today's Progress:
Today I worked on using VictoryJS to chart my tone analysis data in tone chart component. I used ES6's destructuring to pull array objects from user tone props to pass to chart. So neat! So much better than my brute force way of nested map functions to parse and manipulate the data.

### Thoughts:
ES6 for the win! It helped me remove my parse data function and all the nasty looking DOM error messages.
