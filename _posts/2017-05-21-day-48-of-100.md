### Today's Progress:
I worked on refactoring getTweet function and also fixed an issue with the undefined username.

### Thoughts:
I need to work on the timing of my API calls to Twitter and IBM Watson. The behavior of the first time I enter a twitter name isnâ€™t what I am expecting. Perhaps I should upgrade NodeJs to the newer version with async/await.
